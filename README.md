🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Project using SQL
Welcome to my Pizza Sales Analysis project!
This project showcases how SQL can be used for real-world business data analysis by working with a pizza sales database.


📊 Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed pizza sales data using SQL to answer important business questions such as:
Which pizzas are the top-sellers?
What time of day sees the most orders?
Which sizes and categories generate the most revenue?
How does revenue grow over time?
This project strengthened my skills in:
SQL joins
Aggregations
Grouping and filtering
Data-driven decision making


🧩 Dataset Description
The dataset includes four main tables:
orders: contains order-level data including order time and date
order_details: connects orders to pizzas and includes quantity
