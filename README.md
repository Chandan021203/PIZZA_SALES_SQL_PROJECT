🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Project using SQL
Welcome to my Pizza Sales Analysis project!
This project showcases how SQL can be used for real-world business data analysis by working with a pizza sales database.


📊 Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed pizza sales data using SQL to answer important business questions such as:
1. Which pizzas are the top-sellers?
2. What time of day sees the most orders?
3. Which sizes and categories generate the most revenue?
4. How does revenue grow over time?
5. This project strengthened my skills in:
6. SQL joins
7. Aggregations
8. Grouping and filtering
9. Data-driven decision making


🧩 Dataset Description
The dataset includes four main tables:
1. orders: contains order-level data including order time and date
2. order_details: connects orders to pizzas and includes quantity
3. pizzas: contains pizza size and price
4. pizza_types: describes pizza name and category


🧠 Business Questions Answered
Here are some of the insights explored using SQL queries:
1. Total number of orders placed
2. Total revenue generated from sales
3. Highest-priced pizza
4. Most common pizza size ordered
5. Top 5 most ordered pizza types by quantity
6. Total quantity by pizza category
7. Order distribution by hour
8. Category-wise pizza distribution
9. Average pizzas ordered per day
10. Top 3 pizza types by revenue
11. Percentage revenue by pizza type
12. Cumulative revenue over time
13. Top 3 revenue-generating pizza types per category
